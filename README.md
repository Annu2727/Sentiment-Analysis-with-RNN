# Sentiment-Analysis-with-RNN

✅ Purpose of the Project: The notebook builds a Sentiment Analysis model that classifies text (movie reviews or similar) as positive or negative. The core idea is to use Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) (with an Embedding layer and LSTM) to learn patterns in sequences of words.

📝 Sentiment Analysis with RNN

This project demonstrates how to build a sentiment analysis model using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) in Keras/TensorFlow. The model classifies text sequences into positive or negative sentiment.
